when I use 09-deployments/kubia-deployment-and-service-v1.yaml
and change replica to 1 within the file 


spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kubia
  replicas: 1


I will change the number of replicas by command:

# kubectl scale deployment/kubia --replicas=3

Now if one pod fails then there will be other pods to handle the traffic as a service is bound to it too.
